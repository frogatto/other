	║ Critical:                                                                     ║
	║  ▶ Copy is broken on some linux systems.                                      ║
	║  ▶                                                                            ║
	║                                                                               ║
	║ Problematic:                                                                  ║
	║  ▷ When deleting a support, the track doesn't fall down.                      ║
	║  ▷ Make raise tips rotate. Further work needed on graphics.                   ║
	║  ▷ Ojbects spawned in the process of fulfilling the requirements of other     ║
	║    objects when they're built don't delete other objects; bug or intended?    ║
	║  ▷ Automatic raises don't play well with regards to deleting stuff.           ║
	║  ▷ Fix MEG interpretation. See permutate_mutually_exclusive_groups in cursor. ║
	║  ▷ Objects, such as hedges, aren't deleted when they should be.               ║
	║  ▷ Sidebar slews.                                                             ║
	║  ▷ Level loader doesn't function correctly.                                   ║
	║  ▷ Display level titles.                                                      ║
	║  ▷ Window resizing breaks side scrollpane.                                    ║
	║  ▶ The window needs to be resizable, and all that entails.                    ║
	║  ▶ Redo button doesn't deactivate correctly when placing tracks.              ║
	║  ▶ Tutorial hint text.                                                        ║
	║  ▶                                                                            ║
	║                                                                               ║
	║ Minor:                                                                        ║
	║  ▷ Tween scroll input buttons' movement.                                      ║
	║  ▶ Make keyboard input code handle one key/frame, to avoid conflicts.         ║
	║  ▷ Multiply trains' rotation calculation y by whatever we did for the mouse   ║
	║    input.                                                                     ║
	║  ▷ An ereaser button would be nice.                                           ║
	║  ▷ Trains are only one car long.                                              ║
	║  ▶ Z-orders, especially around entrances, are broken.                         ║
	║  ▶ Improve input scheme. Not all keys variabled yet.                          ║
	║  ▶ Rotating view undo/redo recreates pieces, and so breaks the undo/redo of   ║
	║    adding and removing pieces, specifically the ereasure of pieces since they ║
	║    are referenced to in the undo stack by specific object. Solution: make     ║
	║    undo/redo stack accept args, and pass it the /action/ that creates the     ║
	║    change delta (and, hence, the delta generator), not the change delta       ║
	║    itself. As it stands, rotating clears the undo/redo stack.                 ║
	║  ▶ It might be nice to include a line of text explaining the game.            ║
	║  ▶ You need to export the level or return to main map to rotate in editor.    ║
	║  ▶ Add colour change button for entrances.                                    ║
	║  ▶ Stay in level on completion.                                               ║
	║  ▶ Rotation icons are same for camera and track-piece.                        ║
	║  ▶                                                                            ║
	║                                                          ▷ fixed  ▶ not fixed ║
